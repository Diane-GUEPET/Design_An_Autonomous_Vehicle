# Design_An_Autonomous_Vehicle

## Goals
### The use of semantic segmentation for the designing of autonomous vehicle


Autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars and drones can benefit from automated segmentation. 

For example, self-driving cars can detect drivable regions.


In this work, we will use CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to achieve a semantic segmentation.


The deployment of our model and the built of an application which take an image as input and return its segmentation as output will be done with Microsoft Azure.
